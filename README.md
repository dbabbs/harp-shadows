# harp.gl shadows

### [Live Demo](https://dbabbs.github.io/harp-shadows/dist)

This project showcases shadows in the [harp.gl](https://harp.gl) map renderer with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

The lighting and shadow code is in the the `src/shadows.js` file. Directional light is first added to the scene and then the shadow options are configured.
